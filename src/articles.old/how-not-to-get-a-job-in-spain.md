I flew to Italy to visit my Dad earlier this year. In that period, I also went to Málaga to see an old friend and to the UK to see my family.

A day before going back to Brazil, I got an unexpected invite: my friend called me to live with him in Málaga. I cancelled my flight back home and two weeks later I was back in Spain.

As I settled in, I realized that I had around a month to:

- Find a job that sponsored a visa; or
- Marry a European woman; or
- Exit Europe

Here is a timeline for one of the hiring processes I took part in.

## Applying

For the first time in my life, I successfully applied to a position via LinkedIn Easy Apply. I shared my CV with the recruiter, she sent a message and we scheduled a talk.

This was a Frontend Developer hybrid position in Malaga, exactly what I was after.

> Tip: I usually search for positions posted in the last 24h.

## Recruiter Conversation

This was 30 minutes where we went over introductions, some questions such as "Talk a bit about yourself and your professional experience"

She asked how much experience I had with the stack (React, React Native, TypeScript and GraphQL). I mentioned that I had personal projects in production with TypeScript and React. Namely, my websites [css2wind](https://css2wind.com) and [phived](https://phived.com).

> Tip: Ask a question. I default to "What is the size of the developer team?" or "What is the happy path for this hiring process?" (as in, if everything works out perfectly, what will happen).

## Coding Assignment

After the meeting ended, she sent me a coding assignment due in a week:

- It was a JavaScript, React, and Redux Toolkit website
- It had only one commit, with (frankly) pretty terrible code
- I had to review the code as if it was a regular pull request. [Here is my review](https://gist.github.com/LukeberryPi/2833f7f21e2cb102c43bc6406db17749).
- I had to refactor the code since the initial state wasn't functional

I was also asked to implement three features:

- Display movies in a grid and make it responsive
- Implement infinite scroll for the Home and the Search page
- Implement a modal to display the movie trailer

This is [what I delivered](https://luke-berry-movieland.vercel.app).

> Tip: Take home projects are about prioritizing correctly. Make the requirements work first. If you have time to spare, add enhancements.

## Technical Interview

For this stage I talked to two Software Engineers. There was no live coding or review of the code I delivered in the previous stage. They mentioned that they were impressed with the attention to detail of my delivery.

It consisted mostly of questions about the technologies I worked with in the past, such as "what are the differences between React Context API and Redux?", while outlining strengths and downfalls of both approaches.

I felt very comfortable with this since I had been studying a lot of React and Redux. Here are two resources:

- [Redux Pros and Cons](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/1aiol7c/comment/kow7lbq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
- [React Under the Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i793Qm6kv3U&pp=ygUUcmVhY3QgdW5kZXIgdGhlIGhvb2Q%3D)

> Tip: Search the people that will interview you. Look into their carrers, articles, and open source contributions.

## Technical Interview II

This stage took place with an Engineering Manager and focused on my experience with developer teams. She asked what industry and size of teams I had worked with and if I aspired to move into Fullstack or continue focusing solely on Frontend Development.

She also asked "What was the last big technical mistake you made?". This question caught me off-guard, even though it is very common. Luckily, I make a lot of mistakes and comfortably shared the last time I had broken prod and what I did wrong.

> Tip: Be prepared to talk about soft skills. Questions such as "What is a difficult professional situation and how did you overcome it?" should be rehearsed and ready.

## Final Offer

After a week, I got the positive feedback from the company and a final offer: €50000/year, with some perks:

- Reduced work day during August (9-4 instead of 9-5)
- Twenty days of "work from anywhere" per year
- Cost assistance of €1500 per year

I moved onto the onboarding: documentation, signing contracts, and more.

> Tip: At this stage, always ask for a bigger salary than your expectation. You will never get disqualified for it. If you are participating in multiple hiring process, use that as leverage.

## Bad Ending

As the onboarding progressed, the elephant on the room was addressed: the Visa. As a Brazilian-British citizen, I am not allowed to work in Europe without it (thanks, Brexit!).

The visa they were applying for me was a Highly Skilled Professional Visa, which is needed for a foreigner earning above €40000/year in Europe.

A week went by, I signed more contracts and had more meetings. In one of these meetings, they disclosed to me that they couldn't hire me.

Amongst other things, this Visa demands a University Degree. Or 3 years of proven experience in the field. Unfortunately, I had neither.

Even though I have the years of experience, a lot of that is freelancing, which isn't valid for this Visa.

I was heartbroken. I gathered myself to thank everyone involved and then exited gracefully. So close, yet so far.

After I recovered, I had a big decision to make again:

- Go back to Brazil and call it a day, after all I had already overstayed my welcome
- Fly to the UK and try to find a job, since I wouldn't need a Visa to work there (I'm a British Citizen)

I bought a ticket to the UK, with a few plans in mind.
